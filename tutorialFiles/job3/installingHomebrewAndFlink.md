    - Java is reuquired for this installation. If you are unsure if you have a valid Java version (1.8.0+ Version+), use the following command: ```  java -version ```.    
2. After Java has been verified, begin the installation for [Homebrew]("https://brew.sh"). You can find the detailed tutorial instructions [here]("https://brew.sh"). Below are some general instructions / tips:   
    
    <ol type="a">

    <li> Within Terminal, enter the following commnad in its current directory. <br>Note: When running the command, you may be prompted for your passsword. Just type in your appleID password, if that is what you are logged in last night. </li>

    <li> May Be Required: If you noticed that the installation prompts you to create a new <strong>PATH</strong>, run the two commands it prints out after the message. </li>
