# Big Data: PyFlink  
For the project itself, we need to decide on a Big Data tool that is either covered in class or on our own. Each person will be designated a sub-topic (i.e. Specific Function / Method; Certain Data Processing Structure).

## Group Tasks

- [ ] Create Contributor Section
    - [ ] Hyperlinks to Individual Profiles
    - [ ] Insert image / headshot
        - Idea: Hyperlink images to repos with fallback links at the bottom
- [ ] Decide on details
    - [X] Big Data tool (In group title?!)
    - [ ] Programming language
        - Python Language w/ 
    - [ ] Data source(s) 
        - Note: Data sources will be URL since web scraping is invovled
    - [ ] Sub-topics for each member (Note: 4 Members total?)
